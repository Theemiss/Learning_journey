# Descreption
Let's build an RSS feed reader! Most news websites, blogs, podcasts, maintain a RSS feed which gives real-time content updates. You'll build a tool for fetching and converting the feed with a given RSS feed URL. If you aren't familiar with RSS, here's a great introduction to how RSS feeds work.

# Requirements

    The user can input a RSS feed URL.
    The reader will display the title, description, and link of the original content.

# For an extra challenge

    The user can add more than one RSS feed URL.
    Instead of using a RSS parser library, build the parser yourself!


## usage
```
chmod u+x rss.rb
./rss.rb
```
